*The Invitation* is a game all about player interaction. In this PvX MMO the players and the environment dynamically create quests.

I founded tool1game1 GmbH with my close friends Martin Kleingr√§ber und Stephen Fuhrmann. We share the dream of creating games that matter.
My major tasks are Creative Direction, Management, Public Relations, Game Design and Environment Design.
